# Esp32-Projects
This is the code I worked on while learning how to program using Arduino IDE. I mainly worked with Arduino Uno and ESP32. There is some code for esp32 TTGO Sim800L module as well. Here and there some other customized snippets for this or that.
The projects include from  blinking LED's to posting to MQTT servers.
Majority of the code is in public domain and I made all the changes I wanted as I experimented and tinkered.
The credits are mentioned at the top or bottom of each snippet! Feel free to try them out!
